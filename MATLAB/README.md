# MATLAB Folder
## Summary
This folder contains scratch files for prototype the image stitching pipeline.

The `/original/` folder contains an executable but incorrect script from the original paper as of our project timeline:
https://github.com/haohaohao111222/LP-SIFT-Algorithm-Combined-with-RANSAC

The script seems to run, shows keypoints, but does not stitch at all.

## Moving Foward
We will use the file `run_panorama.m` as we continue to prototype the pipeline to replicate the paper's results.

This script was modified from the official MATLAB panorama script here:
